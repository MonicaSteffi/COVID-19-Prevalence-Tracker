# **COVID-19 Prevalence Tracker**

### **Overview**
The **COVID-19 Prevalence Tracker** is a data analysis project designed to monitor and visualize the prevalence of COVID-19 across multiple regions over time. Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of the population currently infected in each region, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's progression and regional impact.

This project uses simulated or real-world data to demonstrate data analysis, visualization, and reporting techniques using R.

---

### **Features**
- **Prevalence Analysis**: Calculates prevalence as a percentage of the population for each region.
- **Temporal Trends**: Tracks prevalence changes over time using line plots and heatmaps.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Highlights differences in prevalence across regions on specific dates.
- **Visualization**: Provides various visualizations, including bar charts, line plots, heatmaps, and boxplots.
- **Scalable Data Handling**: Capable of handling large datasets for comprehensive analysis.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**:
  - `tidyverse`: Data manipulation and visualization
  - `ggplot2`: Advanced data visualization
  - `reshape2`: Data transformation for heatmaps
  - `plotly`: Interactive visualizations (optional)

---

### **Dataset**
The dataset includes:
1. **Date**: Daily entries over a specified time period.
2. **Region**: Names of the regions (e.g., countries or states).
3. **Population**: Total population for each region.
4. **Active Cases**: The number of ongoing COVID-19 cases in each region.
5. **Prevalence (%)**: Calculated as `(Active Cases / Population) * 100`.

Simulated data can be generated using the `simulate_covid_data.R` script or replaced with real-world data from sources such as [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/), or local health authorities.

### **Installation and Setup**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID19-Prevalence-Tracker.git
   cd COVID19-Prevalence-Tracker
   ```
2. Install required R libraries:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "reshape2", "plotly"))
   ```
3. (Optional) If using real data, replace `simulated_covid_data.csv` with your dataset in the same format.

---

### **Usage**
1. **Simulate Data**: Run the `simulate_covid_data.R` script to generate a dataset.
   ```R
   source("simulate_covid_data.R")
   ```
2. **Prevalence Analysis**: Run the analysis script `covid_prevalence_analysis.R` to generate visualizations.
   ```R
   source("covid_prevalence_analysis.R")
   ```
3. **Visualizations**: View the generated plots in the RStudio plot pane or save them as files.

---

### **Visualization Examples**
1. **Prevalence Over Time**:
   - Line plot showing prevalence changes across regions.
   - Highlights trends and peak periods.
   
2. **Regional Comparison**:
   - Bar chart comparing prevalence across regions on the most recent date.
   
3. **Heatmap of Trends**:
   - Heatmap showing temporal changes in prevalence by region.

4. **Prevalence Distribution**:
   - Boxplot illustrating the variability in prevalence across regions.
